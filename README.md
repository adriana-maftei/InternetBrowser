This project is a basic Internet Browser app made with Visual Studio & C# programmming language. The EXE file is available in the "bin" folder. Main features I learned and build while developing this project:

- understanding internet navigation via code
- making a working URL from a simple text box
- working with WinForms
- creating buttons and personalize UI elements on a window
